						<p>Fashion Designer</p>
						<p>Once upon a time, men wore watches to keep track of the hours. Not so much anymore. If you're like most guys, you have a smartphone that tells the time just fine.

We've scoured the earth for the latest and greatest watches—talking to designers, visiting trade shows, and shopping around town.</p>
